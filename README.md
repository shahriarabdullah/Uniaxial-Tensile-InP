# Uniaxial-Tensile-InP
Abdullah Shahriar

Uniaxial tensile simulation of InP nanowire. Structure created with atmosk and simulated using LAMMPS. This project was accomplished in order to validate a journal paper.

Recently I validated a paper titled [Atomistic investigations on the mechanical properties and fracture mechanisms of indium phosphide nanowires](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/cp/c7cp08252e) using molecular dynamics simulation in LAMMPS and visualized in OVITO.

The result compiled below matches with the paper's result-
